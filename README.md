PHYS258 Final Project - The Moon Does Not Twinkle: Comparing the Blue Sky Solar Spectrum with Moonlight

For our PHYS258 final project, we decided to collect terrestrial data of the solar spectrum from the lunar reflection and blue sky. The collected data was then analyze in python, and the results presented in a final paper, included above. We primarily conclude a disagreement between our calculated peak surface temperature of the sun and the expected value 5772 K. On the other hand, we note a high level of precision in our data, and the accuracy of the position of Fraunhofer lines in both spectra. The loss in the spectrum from atmospheric absorption is also highly noticeable and shown against the expected blackbody curve.
